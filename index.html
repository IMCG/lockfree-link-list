            It's a race!
          </h3>
          <p>When multiple threads are making concurrent modifications to a shared data structure, a typical strategy is to use a lock so that only one thread can modify the structure at a time. We’re exploring alternative thread-safe schemes: <em>fine-grained locks</em>, which lock only the most necessary parts of the structure; and <b>atomic memory operations</b>, which allow us to forego locks altogether. Though each of these approaches has its appeals and its drawbacks, <b>we have found lock-free structures to be sensationally faster under conditions of high contention.</b> And perhaps even more important than speed, <b>we’ve discovered lock-free structures to be more energy-efficient than their counterparts.</b></p>
          <h3>Some preliminary data to tease you with</h3>
          <p>We're still tweaking our test cases, but take a look at some of our initial findings.</p>
          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <p>Although our implementation of lock-free linked lists with standard set operations proved to be very fast, it was not a useful data structure. Nobody would ever use a linked list in this manner. We wanted to make a data structure that could be used in real concurrent applications. First, we changed all our sets to tables, i.e. they now used key-value mappings for all the operations. Next, we used our linked-lists as a sub-structure in implementing HashTables that used our lists for chaining of colliding elements. A HashTable is an extremely important data-structure in many applications and algorithms, and our hope is that a lock-free HashTable proves to be of use in concurrent applications. It could, for example, be used as some sort of cache in an intensive parallel computation.</p>
          <p>Memory management proved to be our most challenging problem, and one we did not expect to deal with. In the papers we read, there was no good solution to the problem of freeing memory in lock-free linked lists. If our language was garbage collected, this would not be an issue. However, C++ is not garbage collected, so we would need some sort of scheme for freeing nodes that had been deleted from the list. Unfortunately, any simple scheme introduced race-conditions. A scheme using reference-counting is feasible, but would require a Double Compare-and-Swap unavailable on any machine. The only real solution seems to involve a gargantuan amount of extra code that we simply don't have the time for, even if we had known it would be a problem from the start.</p>
